# Welcome to our Machine Learning project!
This repository contains the source code used for the project.

The scope of the project is classification of clothing images from a subset of the FashionMNIST dataset.  

Dimensionality reduction methods used:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Machine Learning classification methods used:
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Convolutional Neural Network

The project has been worked out by Andreas Kruse Svenningsen and Sebastian Nygaard WÃ¦rling
