# Welcome to the GitHub for our Machine Learning project!
This repository contains the source code used for the project.

The scope of the project is classification of clothing images from the FashionMNIST dataset.  

Dimensionality reduction methods used:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Machine Learning classification methods used:
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Convolutional Neural Network

The project has been worked out by Andreas Kruse Svenningsen and Sebastian Nygaard WÃ¦rling
